/*
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n
. If n
 is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n
 is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n
 is one. For example, the sequence for n=3
 is as follows:
3?10?5?16?8?4?2?1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n
.

Input

The only input line contains an integer n
.

Output

Print a line that contains all values of n
 during the algorithm.

Constraints
1<=n<=10^6
